# Warp

Interface Driven Distributed Data Service

### Overview

Warp can run as a single binary, providing an interface into the core technologies that run Satellite. This allows us to avoid rewriting the same tech over and over when developing for different platforms. Warp will work on most phones, tablets, computers, and consoles.

It provides abstractions to many different modules which are required to run Satellite. These modules include Messaging, Caching, File Sharing & Storage, RTC connections, and more. Because we focus on building these modules as interfaces first and then allow implementation layers to be built on top of these, we can easily change the core technologies with no extra development required on the "front-end" stacks. This means we can jump from multiple blockchains or decentralized solutions without affecting the front-end application.

Additionally, libraries to interface with Warp (will) exist in JavaScript (TypeScript), Java, Python, and more. So you can quickly develop your platforms and integrations on top of the Satellite tech stack. Lastly, a REST API service can be enabled for Warp. However, it should never be exposed outside of localhost.
